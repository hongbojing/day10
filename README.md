# day10
day 10 is the last part of the Raphael tutorial, I learned a lot through the process of re-build the structure of the Raphael knowledge, and I create a new way to see the effect on the lefe and code on the right side, which encourage me to do similar things in the future.

I would definitely do the similar things in the future to make this project more referenceable and reuseable.
